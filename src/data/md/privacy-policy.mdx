## 2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

***In Short:** We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.*

**We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:**

**(a) To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage user accounts.** We may process your information so you can create and log in to your account, as well as keep your account in working order.

**(b) To send you marketing and promotional communications.** We may process the personal information you send to us for our marketing purposes, if this is in accordance with your marketing preferences.

## 3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

***In Short:** We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.*

<ins>**If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.**</ins>

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

**(a) Consent.** We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more
about withdrawing your consent.

**(b) Legitimate Interests.** We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
    
    (i) Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services

    (ii) Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users

**(c) Legal Obligations.** We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.

**(d) Vital Interests.** We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.


In legal terms, we are generally the "data controller" under European data protection laws of the personal information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a "data processor" on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the "data controller" responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want to know more about our customers' privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.

<ins>**If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.**</ins>

We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can [withdraw your consent]() at any time.

In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:

**(a)** If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way

**(b)** For investigations and fraud detection and prevention

**(c)** For business transactions provided certain conditions are met

**(d)** If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim

**(e)** For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin

**(f)** If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse

**(g)** If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province

**(h)** If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to production of records

**(i)** If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession, and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced

**(j)** If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes

**(k)** If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations

## 4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

## 5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?

***In Short:** We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.*

We may use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.

## 6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?

***In Short:** If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.*

Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned but will often include your name, email address, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.

We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider.

## 7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

***In Short:** We keep your information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this notice or as required by law, prioritizing secure storage and timely deletion.*

We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this privacy notice unless a longer retention period is required by law. When your information is no longer needed, we securely delete or anonymize it.

If secure deletion is not immediately possible (e.g., due to backup systems), we ensure the data remains securely stored and isolated from any further processing until it can be deleted. This approach aligns with our commitment to your privacy and security.

## 8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

***In Short:** We encrypt all your data and apply rigorous security measures to keep it safe.*

Your privacy and security are our top priorities. To protect your personal information, we have implemented strong organizational and technical measures, including data encryption at rest and in transit. These safeguards ensure that your information is kept confidential and secure from unauthorized access or misuse.

However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure. While we work tirelessly to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security against cyber threats. Rest assured, we continually update our security practices to mitigate risks and improve protection.

We recommend accessing our services in a secure environment and taking steps to protect your credentials.

## 9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

Should a standardized DNT protocol be established in the future, we will update this privacy notice to ensure compliance and inform you about our practices.
